### Introduction
Funnel charts are often used to represent data in different stages of a business process. It’s an important mechanism in Business Intelligence to identify potential problem areas of a process. For example, it’s used to observe the revenue or loss in a sales process for each stage, and displays values that are decreasing progressively. Each stage is illustrated as a percentage of the total of all values.

### Basic Funnel Plot


```r
# Need to install plotly from Github to get funnel plots
# devtools::install_github("ropensci/plotly")
library(plotly)

fig <- plot_ly() 
fig <- fig %>%
  add_trace(
  type = "funnel",
  y = c("Website visit", "Downloads", "Potential customers", "Requested price", "invoice sent"),
  x = c(39, 27.4, 20.6, 11, 2)) 
fig <- fig %>%
  layout(yaxis = list(categoryarray = c("Website visit", "Downloads", "Potential customers", "Requested price", "invoice sent")))

fig
```

### Setting Marker Size and Color
This example uses [textposition](https://plotly.com/python/reference/#scatter-textposition) and [textinfo](https://plotly.com/python/reference/#funnel-textinfo) to determine information apears on the graph, and shows how to customize the bars.


```r
# Need to install plotly from Github to get funnel plots

library(plotly)

fig <- plot_ly() 
fig <- fig %>%
  add_trace(type = "funnel",

            x = c(39, 27.4, 20.6, 11, 2),
            textposition = "inside",
            textinfo = "value+percent initial",
            opacity = 0.65,
            marker = list(color = c("deepskyblue", "lightsalmon", "tan", "teal", "silver"),

See [https://plotly.com/r/reference/#funnel](https://plotly.com/r/reference/#funnel) and [https://plotly.com/r/reference/#funnelarea](https://plotly.com/r/reference/#funnelarea) for more information and chart attribute options!
### What About Dash?

[Dash for R](https://dashr.plot.ly/) is an open-source framework for building analytical applications, with no Javascript required, and it is tightly integrated with the Plotly graphing library. 

Learn about how to install Dash for R at https://dashr.plot.ly/installation.

Everywhere in this page that you see `fig`, you can display the same figure in a Dash for R application by passing it to the `figure` argument of the [`Graph` component](https://dashr.plot.ly/dash-core-components/graph) from the built-in `dashCoreComponents` package like this:


```r
library(plotly)

fig <- plot_ly() 
# fig <- fig %>% add_trace( ... )
# fig <- fig %>% layout( ... ) 

library(dash)
library(dashCoreComponents)
library(dashHtmlComponents)

app <- Dash$new()
app$layout(
    htmlDiv(
        list(
            dccGraph(figure=fig) 
        )
     )
)

app$run_server(debug=TRUE, dev_tools_hot_reload=FALSE)
```
